Work by [Guo et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.06686.pdf). Graphs are important data representations for describing objects and their relationships, which appear in a wide diversity of real-world scenarios. As one critical problem in this area, graph generation considers learning the distributions of given graphs and generating more novel graphs. Owing to its wide range of applications, generative models for graphs have a rich history, which, however, are traditionally hand-crafted and only capable of modeling a few statistical properties of graphs. Recent advances in deep generative models for graph generation is an important step towards improving the fidelity of generated graphs and paves the way for new kinds of applications. This article provides an extensive overview of the literature in the field of deep generative models for graph generation.
