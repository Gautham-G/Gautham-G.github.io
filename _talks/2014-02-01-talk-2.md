Work by [Murpy et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-24732-2.pdf) Forecasting the evolution of contagion dynamics is still an open problem to which mechanistic models only offer a partial answer. To remain mathematically or computationally tractable, these models must rely on simplifying assumptions, thereby limiting the quantitative accuracy of their predictions and the complexity of the dynamics they can model. The paper proposes a complementary approach based on deep learning where effective local mechanisms governing a dynamic on a network are learned from time series data. Proposed GNN architecture makes very few assumptions about the dynamics, and they demonstrate its accuracy using different contagion dynamics of increasing complexity. By allowing simulations on arbitrary network structures, their approach makes it possible to explore the properties of the learned dynamics beyond the training data. Finally, they illustrate the applicability of our approach using real data of the COVID-19 outbreak in Spain. The results demonstrate how deep learning offers a new and complementary perspective to build effective models of contagion dynamics on networks.
