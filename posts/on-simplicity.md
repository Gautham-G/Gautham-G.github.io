Complexity is easy. Simplicity is hard.

Anyone can add features, options, settings. The difficult work is knowing what to leave out. Every addition is a decision to exclude something else—attention, clarity, focus.

## The paradox of choice

More options seem like freedom, but they often create paralysis. A blank page is terrifying precisely because anything is possible. Constraints liberate. They give us something to push against.

The best tools disappear. You don't think about a good hammer—you think about the nail. The interface between you and your work should be invisible.

## Simplicity is not minimalism

Minimalism can become its own kind of excess—an aesthetic to be performed rather than a principle to guide decisions. True simplicity is functional, not decorative.

A simple solution:

1. Does one thing well
2. Requires no explanation
3. Feels inevitable in retrospect

The goal isn't fewer things. It's fewer *unnecessary* things.

## The courage to subtract

Adding is safe. Removing requires conviction. You have to believe that what remains is sufficient—that nothing essential was lost.

This is why simplicity takes courage. You must be willing to be judged for what's missing, trusting that the absence creates space for what matters.

Start with everything you think you need. Then remove half of it. Then remove half again. What survives is probably close to right.
