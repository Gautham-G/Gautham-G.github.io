Welcome. This is a space for writing.

I wanted something minimal. No distractions, no clutter—just words on a page. A place where ideas can breathe.

## Why a blog?

There's something clarifying about writing for others, even if no one reads it. The act of articulating a thought forces precision. Vague intuitions become concrete claims that can be examined and refined.

## What to expect

I'll write about whatever captures my attention:

- Technology and its implications
- Ideas that challenge assumptions
- Things I'm learning
- Observations about the world

No schedule, no promises. Just writing when there's something worth saying.

Thanks for reading.
