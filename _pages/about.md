Hello! I am an incoming Data Science intern at [Lark Health](https://www.lark.com/). I am also a Master's student in Computational Science and Engineering at the [College of Computing, Georgia Tech.](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/) - where I specialize in Machine Learning and Data Science.

Additionally at Georgia Tech., I have so far worked as a Graduate Student/Research Assistant at [Aditya Lab](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~badityap/covid.html), conducting research on Graph Generation algorithms. Here, I also work with a team that concentrates it's efforts towards deep learning driven disease forecasting which is COVID-19 centric.

Prior to this, I earned a Bachelor's in Engineering Physics and a Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering  at [Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad](https://www.iith.ac.in/). I was fortunate to have been advised by Prof. [Shantanu Desai](https://www.iith.ac.in/phy/shantanud/) where I worked on Machine Learning and Statistical Methods applied to Astrophysical data.

Please find my resume [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ISL_RSTvrrUPN5Rpm5i47RS4_HOu5e7i/view?usp=sharing).
