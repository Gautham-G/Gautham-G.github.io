We apply the generalized Lomb–Scargle periodogram to the 123I and 99mTc decay rate measurements based on data taken at the Bronson Methodist Hospital. The aim of this exercise was to carry out an independent search for sinusoidal modulation for these radionuclei (to complement the analysis in Borrello et al.) at frequencies for which other radionuclei have shown periodicities. We do not find such a modulation at any frequencies, including annual modulation or at frequencies associated with solar rotation. Our analysis codes and datasets have been made publicly available.
